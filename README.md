## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
  - Added main container
  - Added proper class name to each section
- CSS custom properties
  - Added styles based on each elements
- Flex
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first full experience designing and implementing without 100% alone, without following any tutorial and just researching as needed. 
<p>
This project was a great opportunity the fully enbrance and start the journey as a FullStack Engineer.

<p>Still need to practice more to design these kind of components faster and also to design it on my own.


### Continued development

<p> Implement the same component using different approaches, like full SPA using React or even using some framework like Next.js.

<p> A big area of improvement is learning hot to proper document my development process during the implementation and not let all the wording to the end as it may not be that fresh anymore and a few details got be missing.
